The folder contains estimated Zambia end-of-season date in Date of Year (DOY) format in 17 growing seasons: 2000/2001 to 2017/2018.
negative 1 (-1) indicates failed to extract season or no season found.

This Tiff is genergated from MODIS MOD13Q1ï¼Œ from 10/1/2000 to 9/30/2018.

#Key concepts of this dataset:
1) The end-of-season date is defined as the time at 70% green down of the NDVI curve for a given phenology curve.  In other words, each growing season has one up and down in the NDVI curve, and the peak NDVI is defined as 100%. As time goes, the percentage move away from 100% and decrease to 0% at the right-end of the curve. The end-of-season time is at 30% to the minimum on the right side.  This 70% green down is arbitary and not supported by any published article (Differently, for the planting date data, the 30% green up definition of planting date was supported by Urban et al 2018.  See Urban, D., Guan, K., & Jain, M. (2018). Estimating sowing dates from satellite data over the US Midwest: a comparison of multiple sensors and metrics. Remote sensing of environment, 211, 400-412.).

2) The dataset is derived from MODIS MOD13Q1 VI product (16-day, 250m).
Only "good" pixels defined by Quality bands was used.

3) Savitzky-golay filter is used to fill the gap and smooth the time-series NDVI.  A software called TIMESAT is used to implement the savitzky-golay filter.

(TIMESAT states it will extract n-1 'center most' seasons. TIMESAT doc .p23,
Sitian found EITHER the first season OR last season will lost by experiement,
the time index is an reliable way to extract desired season:
dup the first and last seaosn, when extracting 1st season, use date range 17*1 to 17*2; when extracting last season, use date range 306 -17*2 to 306 - 17*1 )
